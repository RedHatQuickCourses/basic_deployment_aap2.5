= Understand the Network Port and Protocols

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for bidirectional traffic between the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform server in order for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.


.Here is a list of ports and protocols with service name:
