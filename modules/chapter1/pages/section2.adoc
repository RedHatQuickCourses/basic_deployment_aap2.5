= On-premise Installation 

There are 3 different ways by which you can do the installation to your local infrastructure i.e. RPM, Containerized, and Operator. In this, we are going to learn about the Future of Deployment method which is known as Containerized installation. The RPM installation is more or less the same and as the RPM will be getting deprecated in the future our focus will be on understanding the other 2 Containerized and Operator-based deployment. 


System Requirements

Since the Container and Operator-based deployment needs 3000 IOPS (input/output operations per second) compared to the VM base Deployment of 1500 IOPS please refer to the below Guides while doing the deployment: 

RPM: The https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/rpm_installation/platform-system-requirements[System requirements, window=_blank ] section of RPM installation. 			

Containerized: The https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/aap-containerized-installation#system_requirements[System requirements, window=_blank ] section of Containerized installation. 			

For https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/tested_deployment_models/ocp-topologies#tested_system_configurations_6[System requirements, window=_blank ] for installing Ansible Automation Platform on OpenShift Container Platform, see the Tested system configurations section of Tested deployment models.

Mode, Infrastructure, Description , Tested topologies
RPM, Virtual machines and bare metal, The RPM installer deploys Ansible Automation Platform on Red Hat Enterprise Linux by using RPMs to install the platform on host machines. Customers manage the product and infrastructure lifecycle., RPM growth topology/RPM mixed growth topology/RPM enterprise topology and RPM mixed enterprise topology
Containers,Virtual machines and bare metal,The containerized installer deploys Ansible Automation Platform on Red Hat Enterprise Linux by using  podman which runs the platform in containers on host machines. Customers manage the product and infrastructure lifecycle, Container growth topology and Container enterprise topology
Operator,Red Hat OpenShift,Operator Red Hat OpenShift The Operator uses Red Hat OpenShift Operators to deploy Ansible Automation Platform within Red Hat OpenShift. Customers manage the product and infrastructure lifecycle,Operator growth topology and Operator enterprise topology
|===

By following the tested deployment models recommended by Red Hat, organizations can ensure a smooth installation and deployment of the Ansible Automation Platform without the need for further actions, making all features and capabilities readily available for use.

The RPM deployment is expected to be deprecated in the future. Therefore, this training will be primarily focused on the other two deployment methods: Containerized and Operator.
