= Components of AAP

*Ansible Core*: It includes the Ansible language and runtime, a set of built-in modules and command-line tools, and a framework for extending automation with collections.

*Unified UI*: Ansible Automation Platform is a modular platform. The Unified UI give you the access to all the ansible automation platform components, such as automation controller, automation hub, Automation Analytics and Event-Driven Ansible controller. 	

*Automation controller / Automation execution*: The Automation controller is the command and control center for Red Hat® Ansible® Automation Platform. It includes a webUI, API, https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/what-is-role-based-access-control[role-based access control (RBAC), window=_blank ], a workflow visualizer, and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) integrations to help you organize and manage automation across your enterprise.

Automation controller brings a systematic approach to automation with Ansible Automation Platform. Standardizing how automation is deployed, initiated, delegated, and audited, allows enterprises to automate with confidence, while reducing sprawl and variance across IT environments.
It is now integrated into the Automation Unified UI with the name  Automation execution. 

*Automation hub / Automation content*: Ansible automation hub is a central repository to discover, download, and manage https://www.ansible.com/products/content-collections[Ansible Content Collections , window=_blank] bundles of https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-an-ansible-module[modules, window=_blank], plug-ins, https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-an-ansible-role[roles, window=_blank], and documentation from Red Hat and our partners. Included with your Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform subscription, the Ansible Content Collections found in the Automation hub helps teams automate new projects faster.

https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/get-started-private-automation-hub[Private automation hub, window=_blank] is an on-premise repository that allows enterprises with disconnected environments to manage, share, and curate content generated internally and control access to Red Hat and partner-created content.

*Automation EDA  / Automation decisions*: Event-driven Ansible provides the event-handling capability needed to automate time-consuming tasks and respond to changing conditions in any IT domain.
Event-driven Ansible can process events containing discrete intelligence about conditions in the IT environment, determine the appropriate response to the event, and then execute automated actions to address or remediate the event. It can help you get more out of existing tools by using their observability data to automate actions at every stage of the operational life cycle.

*Execution nodes*: These are the worker nodes for the automation Controller  as  it is used to execute the playbook and send the status updates back to the automation controller related to the job run. They don't have the GUI like Automation Controller but are connected to the controller to extend its execution capabilities. It helps to obtain the global scaling capabilities of the Ansible Automation Platform. These can be defined as  node_type=execution while doing the deployment. 

*Hop Nodes*: When an organization wishes to have a network that is isolated and does not want to expose its Execution node to the internet, the Hop nodes serve as a connection passthrough proxy. These can be specified as node_type=hop when AAP is being installed.

*Database*:  Every application, such as the automation controller and automation hub, has its own unique database created inside the Postgres database, which is used in the background to store the application's data. The Postgres database has a public schema by default, but it can be modified based on the needs of the application.

*Redis*: Redis is a high-performance, in-memory data store commonly used as a cache, database, and message broker. It provides versatility for a range of use scenarios by supporting many data structures, including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more. Redis is perfect for real-time applications that need quick access to data because of its sub-millisecond response times.

*Automation Mesh*: Automation mesh primarily supports peer-to-peer network connectivity between the controller nodes and the execution/hop nodes through the utilization of a service known as a receptor. It maintains the connection and helps the Controller node to get updates from the worker node or to assign the work to the worker nodes.
