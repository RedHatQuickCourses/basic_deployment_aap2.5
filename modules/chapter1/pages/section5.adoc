. Once the lab is deployed and you are accessing the system via *ssh* terminal make sure to run everything as a normal user only and use the sudo command to perform any root-level operations. 

. Install the required and useful utilities:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
 $ sudo dnf install -y wget git-core rsync vim ansible-core
----

. Go to the link and get the installer link:  https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/480/ver=2.5/rhel---9/2.5/x86_64/product-software[Containerized Ansible Automation Platform]


. Download the installer file: 
+ 
[source,bash,role=execute]
---- 
$ wget -O aap.tar.gz "<paste-link-here taken from step 4>"
----

. Extract the *aap.tar.gz* file using the following command:
+ 
[source,bash,role=execute]
---- 
$ tar -xvf aap.tar.gz
----

. Get the hostname from the system and copy it.
+ 
[source,bash,role=execute]
---- 
$ hostname
----

. Enter the extracted folder and Open the *inventory-growth* file using the *vim* command and change the below 
+ 
[source,bash,role=execute]
---- 
aap.example.org → < paste system hostname>
<set your own> → redhat

<set your own> ← This value can be customized as per your need but remember to use the same while doing the login after the deployment.  
----

. Once the inventory file is ready follow the below steps to do the installation: 
+ 
[source,bash,role=execute]
---- 
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory-growth ansible.containerized_installer.install
---- 

. Simply use the hostname from the lab deployment login page and try to access the URL from the browser on the port *443*.

. Use the user *admin* and the *password* set during the time of installation. In the above video i set it to *redhat*. 

 Note: Try to use stronger password while doing the enterprise deployment 

. Provide the *Red Hat login ID* to get the subscription for attaching it to the AAP and *60-day subscription to Red Hat Ansible® Automation Platform* or *Red Hat Developer Subscription for Individuals* subscription can be used for this lab.
